# Arduino Quadcopter using MPU-6050

##Description
Volant is a flight controller for a quadcopter which is completely designed on a Arduino Uno and MPU-6050 (a MEMS 6 Axis Gyroscope and Accelerometer). The flight controller uses 4 channels of the reciever/transmitter to control the Roll, Pitch and Yaw of the quadcopter.
The flight controller code by Joop Brokking was modified to build this flight controller.
